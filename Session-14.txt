-->Test Plan:
-A Test Plan Document is a formal document in software testing that describes the scope, objectives, approach, resources, schedule, and activities of the testing process. It acts as a blueprint or guide for the testing team, ensuring that everyone understands what needs to be tested, how it will be tested, and the expected outcomes.

It is usually prepared by the Test Lead / QA Manager during the planning phase of the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC).

-->âœ… Key Elements of a Test Plan Document
-Test Plan Identifier â€“ Unique ID or version of the test plan.
-Introduction â€“ Overview of the project, purpose of testing, and objectives.
-Test Items â€“ Features/modules of the software that need to be tested.
-Features to be Tested â€“ Specific functionalities and requirements to be validated.

-Test Approach / Strategy â€“ Testing techniques (manual, automation, functional, non-functional).
-Pass/Fail Criteria â€“ Conditions to determine test success or failure.
-Test Deliverables â€“ Documents and reports (test cases, test scripts, defect logs, summary report).
-Test Environment â€“ Hardware, software, tools, and configurations required.
-Schedule & Milestones â€“ Timeline for different testing phases.
-Roles & Responsibilities â€“ Who will perform which tasks.
-Risks & Contingencies â€“ Possible challenges and backup plans.
