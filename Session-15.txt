-->Use Case:
-A Use Case is a written description of how a user (called an actor) interacts with a system to achieve a specific goal.It defines the functional requirements of a system from the end-user’s perspective and explains what the system should do, not how it will be implemented.

-->✅ Key Points about a Use Case
-Actor – The user or external system that interacts with the application.
-Goal – The objective the actor wants to achieve.
-System – The software or application that provides the service.
-Scenario / Flow – The step-by-step sequence of interactions between actor and system.

-->📌 Structure of a Use Case
-Use Case Name – Describes the function (e.g., “User Login”).
-Actors – Who initiates the use case (e.g., Registered User).
-Preconditions – What must be true before the use case starts (e.g., User must have an account).
-Trigger – The action that starts the use case (e.g., User clicks "Login").
-Main Flow (Basic Flow) – The standard steps of interaction.
-Alternate Flow – Variations or optional paths (e.g., Forgot Password).
-Exceptions – Error handling or failure conditions (e.g., Invalid credentials).
-Postconditions – What happens after successful completion (e.g., User is redirected to dashboard).

-->📖 Example of a Use Case: "User Login"
-Actor: Registered User
-Precondition: User has a valid username and password.
-Trigger: User clicks on the login button.
-Main Flow:
-User enters username and password.
-System validates credentials.
-System grants access to the user.
-Alternate Flow: User clicks "Forgot Password" → System sends reset link.
-Exception: Invalid credentials → Show error message.
-Postcondition: User is logged into the system.

-->👉 In short:
A Use Case = A clear scenario that explains how a user interacts with a system to achieve a goal.

-----------------------------------------
-->✅ Test Scenario
-A Test Scenario is a high-level description of what needs to be tested.It represents a real-world use case or functionality of the application.
-Focus: What to test
-Broad and abstract
-Ensures end-to-end coverage
-->👉 Example:
-For a Login Page
-Test Scenario 1: Verify that the user can log in with valid credentials.
-Test Scenario 2: Verify that login fails with invalid credentials.
-Test Scenario 3: Verify the "Forgot Password" functionality.

----------------------------------------------------
-->✅ Test Case
-A Test Case is a detailed set of steps, inputs, and expected results created for each test scenario.It defines how to test a particular feature.
-Focus: How to test
-Detailed and specific
-Ensures correctness and accuracy
-->👉 Example:
-For Test Scenario 1: User logs in with valid credentials
-Test Case ID: TC001
-Title: Verify successful login with valid username and password
-Precondition: User has a registered account
-Test Steps:
-Open login page
-Enter valid username
-Enter valid password
-Click on "Login" button
-Expected Result: User should be redirected to the dashboard

-->👉 Shortcut yaad rakhne ke liye:
-Scenario = Story (what user wants to do)
-Case = Steps (how tester will check it)

------------------------------------------------------------
-->Test Suite:
A Test Suite is a collection (set) of test cases that are grouped together to test a particular feature, module, or the entire system.It helps organize and manage test cases so that testers can execute them systematically.

-->📌 Key Points
-A test suite may contain manual or automated test cases.
-It is usually created in a Test Management Tool (like JIRA, TestRail, Quality Center, etc.).
-Suites can be arranged feature-wise, module-wise, or release-wise.
-Purpose: To make test execution structured and repeatable.

-->📖 Example
-For a Login Module, a Test Suite might include:
-Test Case 1 – Verify login with valid credentials
-Test Case 2 – Verify login with invalid credentials
-Test Case 3 – Verify login with empty fields
-Test Case 4 – Verify “Forgot Password” functionality
-Test Case 5 – Verify system locks after 5 failed login attempts
-->👉 Here, all these related test cases together form the Login Test Suite.
