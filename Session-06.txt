3.Functional Testing is a type of software testing where the focus is on checking whether the application’s features (functions) work according to requirements.
--It answers the question:
👉 “Does the software do what it is supposed to do?”
-->Key Points:
-Tests each function of the software by giving inputs and checking outputs.
-Based on requirements (not how it looks, but how it works).
-Checks core features like login, booking, payments, database updates, etc.
-Usually performed using techniques like black-box testing.
-->Example (Hotel Management Website):
In functional testing, you will check:
-Login Functionality – If a user enters correct credentials, they should log in successfully; if wrong, an error should appear.
-Hotel Search – When a user enters city + dates, the system should show available hotels.
-Booking – After clicking “Book Now,” the system should reserve the hotel room and update availability.
-Payment – If a user pays, the transaction should be processed and confirmation should be sent.
-Contact Form – When a user submits the contact form, the data should be stored or emailed correctly.
-->👉 In short, functional testing ensures that the software features work correctly as per the requirements.

--Testers follows the following steps:
1.Verification/analysis of the requirements specification in the software application.
2.Create test plan.
3.design test case.
4.Make requirements traceability matrix(RTM) is to trace the requirements with its corresponding test scenerios and test case.
5.Execute test case design
6.analysis of the coverage to examine the covered testing area of the application.Find the area of requirement not implemented by a set of test case.Helps to create additional test cases to increase coverage.Identifying meaningless test cases that do not increase coverage.
7.Defect management should do to manage defect resolving.[IMG-Defect Management]

--Testing that done under the functional testing:
1.Database testing
2.Calculation testing
3.Error handling testing
4.Hypeerlink testing in web application
5.Cookie testing(on client side)
6.Session testing(on server side)
