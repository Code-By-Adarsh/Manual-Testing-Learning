-->What is Software Testing?
Ans:Software testing is a part of software development process where product is verified and validate to ensure:
1.bugfree
2.meets the customer reqiurements
3.timely delivered within budget
4.matainable product

-->Why Software Testing is important?
1.cost-effective
2.secrity
3.product quality
4.customer satisfcation

-->Error,Bug/defect,Failure
1.Error:A human mistake made during software development (coding, design, or requirement analysis) that can lead to a defect in the software.
Ex:A developer writes = instead of == in a condition:

2.Bug/Defect:A bug or defect is a flaw in the software that causes it to behave incorrectly or not meet requirements. Usually detected during testing.
Ex:
Requirement: “The system should accept passwords of 8–16 characters.”
Implementation allows passwords of only 6–16 characters.
This is a defect/bug in the software.

3.Failure:A failure occurs when a defect is executed in the real system, causing it to behave incorrectly or crash. It is visible to the user.
Ex:Due to the above defect, a user enters a 7-character password, and the login system crashes or denies access.
This is a failure.
