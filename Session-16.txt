-->It contains:
-Step-by-step actions
-Test data
-Expected results
-Actual results (after execution)
-Pass/Fail status
-->ðŸ‘‰ Purpose: To ensure each functionality is tested in a structured and repeatable way.

Tools for Test Case Management:
1.Excel (for small and college projects)
2.TestRail (For big mnc's and future job tool way)
3.Jira+Zephyr (A good duo where jira used for bug tracing and management and additional plugin used to test case management).
