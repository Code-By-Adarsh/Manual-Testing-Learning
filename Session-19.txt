-->Test Closure Phase Activities
-The Test Closure Phase is the final phase of the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC). It ensures that the testing process is properly completed and documented.
-->Main activities include:
-Check Test Completion – Verify that all planned test cases are executed and major defects are resolved.
-Defect Analysis – Review defect statistics (fixed, open, deferred, rejected).
-Archiving Test Artifacts – Store test cases, scripts, test data, logs, and reports for future use.
-Collect Metrics – Capture testing metrics to measure effectiveness and efficiency.
-Lessons Learned / Retrospective – Discuss what went well and what needs improvement in the next cycle.
-Prepare Test Closure Report – Summarize the entire testing effort.

------------------------------------------------
-->Test Metrics
-Metrics = measurable values that indicate the progress, quality, and effectiveness of testing.
-Examples of common test metrics:
-Defect Density = Defects found / Size of the module (e.g., per KLOC or Function Point).
-Defect Leakage = Defects found after release / Total defects.
-Test Case Execution Rate = (Executed Test Cases / Total Test Cases) × 100.
-Defect Removal Efficiency (DRE) = (Defects removed before release / Total defects) × 100.
-Test Coverage = (Requirements covered by test cases / Total requirements) × 100.
-Pass/Fail Percentage = % of test cases passed vs failed.

--------------------------------------------------
-->Test Closure Report
-This is the final document prepared in the Test Closure phase. It provides a complete summary of testing.
-Typical contents include:
-Test Summary – Scope, objectives, modules tested.
-Test Deliverables – Test cases, scripts, data, reports archived.
-Metrics & Results – Execution status, defect statistics, DRE, coverage.
-Defect Analysis – Number of defects found, fixed, open, deferred.
-Risks & Issues – Any unresolved risks or open items.
-Lessons Learned – Improvements for future projects.
-Sign-off – Formal approval from stakeholders that testing is complete.
