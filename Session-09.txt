-->🔹 Smoke Testing
-Definition: A type of software testing performed to ensure that the basic and critical functionalities of the application work fine after a new build or update.
-Purpose: To check whether the build is stable enough for further, deeper testing.
-Scope: Shallow and wide (covers major features but not in detail).
-When done: Right after receiving a new build.
-->Example:
-In your hotel booking website, after a new build, smoke testing would check:
-Can the website open?
-Can users log in?
-Can they search hotels?
-Can they book?
-If any of these fail, testers reject the build.

-->🔹 Sanity Testing
-Definition: A type of software testing performed after a minor change or bug fix to verify that the specific functionality is working correctly and hasn’t broken related modules.
-Purpose: To confirm the rationality of the build after small changes.
-Scope: Narrow and deep (focuses on specific functionality).
-When done: After receiving a minor build update.
-->Example:
-Suppose the payment gateway bug was fixed in your hotel booking website.
-Sanity testing would check:
-Is the payment gateway working now?
-Are related features like invoice generation and booking confirmation still fine?

-->✅ Key Difference:Smoke Testing → “Is the build stable enough for testing?” (broad check).
Sanity Testing → “Was the new change/bug fix implemented correctly?” (specific check).

-->👉 Easy memory tip:
-Smoke = Health checkup of the whole body 🩺
-Sanity = Focused check on the part that got treated 🔍
