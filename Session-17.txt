-->✅ 1. Test Environment Setup
-Definition:
Test Environment is the setup of hardware + software + network + tools + configurations where testers execute test cases.Ye basically ek controlled environment hota hai jo production environment ke jaisa hota hai.

-->🔹 Components of a Test Environment:
-Hardware – Servers, client machines, mobile devices, etc.
-Software – OS, databases, browsers, application under test.
-Network/Configuration – Firewalls, VPN, IPs, cloud setups.
-Test Data – Sample or dummy data for execution.
-Tools – Automation tools (Selenium, Appium), Test management tools (Jira, TestRail), etc.

-->🔹 Example:
-For a Banking Web Application:
-OS: Windows/Linux
-Database: MySQL/Oracle
-Web Server: Apache/Tomcat
-Browser: Chrome, Firefox
-Test Data: Customer IDs, Account Numbers
-Tools: Selenium + TestNG for automation, Jira for bug tracking
-->👉 Purpose: To make sure application works in a realistic environment before going live.

-->✅ 2. Test Case Execution
-Definition:
Test Case Execution means running the test cases (manual ya automated) on the application in the test environment and comparing actual result vs expected result.

-->🔹 Steps in Test Case Execution:
-Ensure Test Environment is ready (server up, DB connected, app
deployed).
-Pick test cases from the Test Suite.
-Execute test cases (manual → follow steps, automation → run scripts).
-Record Actual Result.
-Compare with Expected Result.
-Mark test case as Pass or Fail.
-If Fail → Raise a Defect in bug tracking tool (e.g., Jira, Bugzilla).
-Retest after developer fixes it.

-->🔹 Example:
-Test Case: Verify login with valid credentials.
-Steps: Open login page → Enter valid username/password → Click login.
-Expected Result: Redirect to dashboard.
-Actual Result: Redirect to dashboard.
-Status: ✅ Pass
-👉 Purpose: To check if the application works as per requirements.
