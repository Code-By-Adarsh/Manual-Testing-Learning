-->🔹 Ad-hoc Testing
-Definition: Ad-hoc testing is an informal and unstructured type of software testing performed without test cases, plans, or documentation.
-Purpose: To find defects through random and creative testing approaches that are not covered in formal test cases.
-Who performs: Usually done by experienced testers who have good knowledge of the application.
-When done: Anytime, but commonly after formal testing, to try and break the system in unexpected ways.
-->Example:
In your hotel booking website:
Formal testing checks hotel search with valid inputs like “Mumbai” or “Pune.”
But in Ad-hoc testing, the tester might try random inputs like:
Very long strings (“aaaaaaaa…”)
Special characters (“@$%#^”)
Empty values
Booking with negative price
These tests are not written in any document, but may uncover hidden bugs.

-->✅ Key Points:
-No proper planning or documentation.
-Performed randomly, based on tester’s intuition and experience.
-Helps to discover unexpected defects.

-->👉 Easy memory tip:
-Ad-hoc = "On the spot, no plan" testing 🎯
